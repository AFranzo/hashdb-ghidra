# hashdb-ghidra

We are working on a Ghidra plugin for [HashDB][]. This is an ongoing comminity effort, and the plugin
is still under development. It is currently not expected to be fully functional, and not every
feature will work correctly, or at all. We are hackering as fast as we can, and this message will
update as soon as the project is deemed ready for use.

Regardless, please don't hesitate to check it out in early access, report any issues you may encounter,
and join the [OALabs][] Discord [oalabs-dev][] channel.
